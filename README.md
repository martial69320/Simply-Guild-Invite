# SimplyGInv
Addon
Simply Guild Invite adds a "Simply Guild Invite" popup in menu, to make it easier to add someone as a Guild member.

 

I created new account because my old Aravu account was banned from Twitch with no reason, so I reupload my addon on my new account.

I hoped 8.3 was working on 9.1 but Blizzard changed Friend Frame api so I just updated it to fix and made it work
