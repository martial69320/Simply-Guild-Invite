# SimplyGInv
Addon
Simply Guild Invite adds a "Simply Guild Invite" popup in menu, to make it easier to add someone as a Guild member.
Work with:
 Friends list
 Name in chat
 Unit Frame
 Linked Realms
 
I hoped 8.3 was working on 9.1 but Blizzard changed Friend Frame api so I just updated it to fix and made it work
